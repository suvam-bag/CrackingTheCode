# CrackingTheCode

The solutions are in C++. 

Some of these solutions are written by me, while some are borrowed, either source code or algorithm from the book or other repositories like - 
https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-cpp
https://github.com/Hawstein/cracking-the-coding-interview

The purpose of the repository is to keep the solutions in one place. 
I do not claim ownership to the solutions. Anybody looking to brush up algorithms or C++ in general are free to use the solutions for practice etc. 

Thank you!
